        	<p>After Covid, inflation being on the rise and an unstable economy, finding security in knowing that
            I could provide for myself and future family if need be during another crisis is essential. Thats why my main reasons 
            for wanting to code as a living are the ability to work from home, and good pay.

        	<h2>Work from Home</h2>
        	<p id = "mainHeading">Being able to work from home is very important to me. I deal with plenty of social anxiety and other personal problems, that if given the privacy of being able to be at home during work, makes dealing wit those problems a lot more managable.
            I also deal with a slipping vertebrae, so the ablity to not have to stand during work is also a plus. Commutes and gas prices add to this as well.

        	<h2>Good Pay $ &cent; &euro; &yen;</h2>
        	<p class = "funParagraph">I mean not much else to say here... most jobs today don't pay $h!t for the work you put in, so being able to work hard for not a minimum wage job would be great.</p>
